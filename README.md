robIn a quiet town, a small robot named Lumo wandered aimlessly, its circuits flickering with confusion. It had no memory of where it came from or what its purpose was. As twilight fell, Lumo stumbled upon an ancient building glowing softly under the moonlight — an old library filled with towering shelves of dusty books.

Curious, Lumo entered, its tiny lights illuminating forgotten corners and pages filled with stories from long ago. The library’s caretaker, a kind elderly woman named Mrs. Wren, noticed the gentle robot and welcomed it warmly. She showed Lumo how to read and helped it understand the world through the stories hidden in the books.

Day by day, Lumo felt its purpose grow stronger. It became the library’s helper, organizing books and sharing tales with visitors. No longer lost, the little robot found a true home among the stories and the people who loved them, proving that sometimes, the greatest journeys lead us to where we belong.
